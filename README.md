# knudstorp.github.io
SÃ¸ren's personal website, based on So Simple's Jekyll theme

  * Modify _config.yml for global settings affecting all of the website. 
  * Modify index.md for front page
  * Modify _data/navigation for settings regarding the top navigation panel
  * Modify files in the folder "subsites" for specific sites accessible from the top pabel
  * Modify _includes/head-custom.html for favicon. To do this, use, e.g., https://realfavicongenerator.net/, upload your favicon to this website, download the resulting zip-file from there, upload the extracted files to /images/favicon, and insert the code into _includes/head-custom.html.
  * _includes/footer has been copied from So Simple in order to make footer icons open in new tabs when clicked. This has been done by adding target="_blank" in code line 12.
  * Use the following to start adding colour: <text style="color: rgb(34, 139, 34);">coloured text</text>
