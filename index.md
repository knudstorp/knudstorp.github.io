Hi, and welcome to my academic website! My name's SÃ¸ren, and I'm a PhD candidate in Logic at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation in Amsterdam, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.marialoni.org/" style="color: #0a71e0; text-decoration: none;">Maria Aloni</a>{:target="_blank"} and <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/n.bezhanishvili/" style="color: #0a71e0; text-decoration: none;">Nick Bezhanishvili</a>{:target="_blank"} as part of the <a href="https://projects.illc.uva.nl/nihil/" style="color: #0a71e0; text-decoration: none;">NihiL Project</a>{:target="_blank"}.

I hold a <a href="https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/2226/" style="color: #0a71e0; text-decoration: none;">master's</a>{:target="_blank"} degree in Logic from the ILLC, University of Amsterdam, and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Copenhagen. 
My interests include philosophy, mathematics, and logic, with a specific focus on their intersections. <!-- Currently, I am particularly interested in understanding how logics relate. -->
