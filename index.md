Hi and welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in Logic at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation in Amsterdam, working under the supervision of [Maria Aloni](https://www.marialoni.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Nick Bezhanishvili](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/n.bezhanishvili/){:target="_blank"} as part of the [NihiL Project.](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/nihil/){:target="_blank"}

I hold a [master's](https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/2226/){:target="_blank"} degree in Logic from the ILLC, University of Amsterdam, and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Copenhagen. 
My interests include philosophy, mathematics, and logic, with a specific focus on their intersections. <!-- Currently, I am particularly interested in understanding how logics relate. -->
