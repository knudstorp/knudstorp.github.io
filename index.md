I am a PhD candidate in Logic at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation in Amsterdam, working under the supervision of Maria Aloni and Nick Bezhanishvili as part of the NihiL Project.

I hold a master's degree in Logic from the University of Amsterdam, ILLC, and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Copenhagen. 
My interests span philosophy, mathematics, and logic, with a specific focus on their intersections. Currently, I am particularly interested in how logics relate.
