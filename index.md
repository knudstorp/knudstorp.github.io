I am a PhD candidate in Logic at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation in Amsterdam, working under the supervision of [Maria Aloni](https://www.marialoni.org/) and [Nick Bezhanishvili](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/n.bezhanishvili/) as part of the [NihiL Project.](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/nihil/)

I hold a [master's](https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/2226/) degree in Logic from the University of Amsterdam, ILLC, and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Copenhagen. 
My interests span philosophy, mathematics, and logic, with a specific focus on their intersections. Currently, I am particularly interested in understanding how logics relate. 

Three skins (default, light, and dark) are available to change the color palette of the theme.
